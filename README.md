This displays all image attachments for the current post, sorted by menu order.

Optional Attributes

Attaching Images

Pulp Gallery displays images attached to the post. To attach images:

Upload images using the Media Library while editing that post

Save the post

WordPress automatically associates those images with the post, and the shortcode displays them.

RSS Fallback

Medium‑sized images

Each linking to the full image

No buttons, no scripts, no interactive UI

This keeps feeds clean and readable.
