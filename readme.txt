Pulp Gallery

A lightweight, zero‑bloat WordPress gallery plugin designed for clean, responsive image browsing with swipe navigation on mobile.

Description
Pulp Gallery displays post‑attached images in a simple, touch‑friendly gallery using a single shortcode. It’s fast, dependency‑free, and ideal for multi‑page scans, magazines, comics, and archival image sets. Features include swipe navigation, keyboard support, thumbnail strip, and an RSS‑safe fallback for feed readers.
